📊 Customer Churn Prediction (CCP)

🔍 Project Overview
  This project predicts customer churn using "machine learning" techniques. It analyzes customer data and determines whether they are likely to leave based on various factors. The model achieves an "accuracy of 92.8%" using a "Random Forest Classifier".

🚀 Features

🔸Dynamic Feature Selection: Users can choose relevant features like `Tenure`, `WarehouseToHome`,`PreferedCat`, `SatisfactionScore`, `MaritalStatus`,`LastOrder`, `Cashback`, `etc` .

🔸User-Friendly Input: Collects feature values through console prompts.

🔸Data Handling: Manages missing values and cleans the dataset.

🔸Visualization: Generates insightful charts for data exploration.

🔸High Accuracy: Achieves a remarkable R² score of ~0.95.

🔸Target Variable: `Churn` (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

⚙️ Technologies Used

 🔸Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

 🔸Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
